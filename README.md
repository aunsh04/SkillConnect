# SkillConnect

## Problem Statement
Today, students are looking to develop skills to build their careers as well as pursue their interests. There is no platform to share knowledge, interests as well as act as a stage to advertise one’s skills to professors and recruiters. There is often a gap between students and professors, recruiters where the students are unsure about the skills needed for a particular job – for eg. research under a professor or an internship/full time job at a company. This project will serve as a way to bridge this gap and act as a hub of knowledge and relevant study resources.

## Proposed Solution
SkillConnect is an application that will act as a hub of study resources for students where students can view online courses from different websites, research papers, books of their interest. It will also serve as an opportunity for professors and recruiters to follow student’s activities and provide valuable suggestions – for eg. a professor can recommend a book, a recruiter can endorse a course. The application will thus help in bridging the gap between students and professionals which would help professors and recruiters identify talented and skilled individuals.

The primary purpose of this application is to serve as a knowledge hub and a portal to bridge the gap between students and professors, recruiters. There are four potential domain objects and the relations between them are:

Courses: The application provides information for online courses related to different topics and subjects from websites like Udacity, edX and Udemy. Details such as course description, cost, professors and the url of the course dashboard page
Reviews: The application fetches the course reviews from the relevant APIs and students can provide a review for the course they have taken
Research Papers: Professors can upload their research papers which can be viewed by students. This will help students learn, identify and communicate with professors currently working in their areas of interest
Books: Users can view books of different domains – students can view books of their interest, Professors can endorse a book for students which can help students study for a course or gain knowledge
